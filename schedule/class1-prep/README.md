# Class 1 Prep

Before coming to Class 1, please complete the following tasks:

## Javascript Basics

For the first few weeks, we will be using an interactive textbook called [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net). Before you begin reading, please quickly read over the [Notes](./#notes) below.

Did you read the notes? Great, time to dive into learning some Javascript!

Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate | Instructions
-----|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS: Introduction ][eloquent-intro] | 10 minutes | In the Intro, the author Marijn Haverbeke expounds on the nature of his book, the nature of code, and the nature of the universe.
Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 1: Values, Types an Operators][eloquent1] | 30 minutes | This chapter covers all the basics: simple math, strings, datatypes, printing, boolean operators, etc.
Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 2: Program Structure][eloquent2] | 1.5 hours | In chapter 2 you will learn how to build simple programs using control-flow structures like variables, functions, conditionals and loops.
Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 3: Functions][eloquent3] | 3 hours | This chapter talks in depth about functions, touching on abunhc of important but tricky concepts including: recursion, side effects vs return values, and the fact that JS functions can be stored in variables just like any other data type.

## Git Review (optional)

You have already seen some of these resources in Unit 2. But you might find it useful to go through them again.

Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate | Instructions
|----|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
Read | Article | [What is Version Control?][what-is-version-control] | 10 minutes | This article introduces the concept of "version control" and why it is useful for software development.
Read | Article | [What is Git?][what-is-git] | 10 minutes | This article talks in detail about a particular version control system called Git, which we will be using heavily throughout this class.
Do | Interactive Course | [Codecademy: Git Workflow][codecademy1] | 30 minutes | Practice the basics of using Git on the command line.
Do | Interactive Course | [Codecademy: Git Backtracking][codecademy2] | 30 minutes | Practice using Git to undo your changes and go back to previous versions of your work.
Do | Tutorial | [Github Guides: Hello World][github-hello-world] | 30 minutes | This tutorial provides a brief intro to using the website GitHub to share and collaborate on Git repositories.


## Notes

There are a few things we want to point out about the Eloquent Javascript book and about Prep Work in general:

### Active Code

Note that all the code snippets in Eloquent Javascript are "active". Whenever you see a code snippet, you can (and should) run the code and see what happens. You also can (and should) edit the code and then re-run it, to play around and test your understanding:

### Exercises

Most of the book's chapters contain exercises at the end. Do them! The bare minimum expectation is that you **complete at least 1 exercise for each reading** (unless there are none). To "complete" an exercise means either you solve it, or you struggle with it for 30 - 60 minutes, give or take. And in either case, you should also go and look at the author's solution afterwords, which can be found at [www.eloquentjavascript.net/code](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code). If you have time, you should do additional exercises beyond the minimum 1.

### Time Estimates

The intention of the *Time Estimate* column in the table above is to give you a **very rough** approximation of how large and time-intensive each task is. The **only purpose** of this is to help you plan your schedule. Take it with a grain of salt. If a task ends up taking you four times as long as what the table said, please don't get angry at us, or down on yourself, or anything else negative. Thanx!
