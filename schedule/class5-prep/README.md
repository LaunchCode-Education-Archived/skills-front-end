# Class 5 Prep

Before coming to class 5, please complete the following tasks:



### Quick Review of CSS Selectors

The main topic for this Prep Work is a Javascript library called jQuery. But first, let's quickly review a little bit of CSS. You might have already done the Codecademy lesson below in a previous Unit. But before moving on to jQuery, it will be helpful to review a familiar example of how selectors work.

Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate |Instructions
-----|---------------|------|---------------|------------
Do | Interactive Course | [Codecademy: CSS Selectors][css-selectors] | 30 minutes | This lesson introduces "selectors", which allow you to specify exactly *which* elements you want to apply a style to.


### jQuery

You have seen how to manipulate the DOM using Javascript functions like `document.getElementById()`. That's great, but once you start trying to combine a few operations to do something complicated, the "vanilla" way adds up to a clumsy experience. jQuery is a Javascript library that provides a very flexible syntax for querying and modifying the DOM, and chaining those statements together to form more complicated operations. jQuery does additional things as well, but its biggest role is to make it easier to do fancy things with the DOM.

Eloquent Javascript does not talk about jQuery, so we will use a short Udacity course.

Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate | Instructions
-----|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
Do | Interactive Course | [Udacity: Intro to jQuery][udacity-jquery] | 6 hours | Go through the entire course. (This one is very short compared to other Udacity courses.)
