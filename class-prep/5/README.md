Class 5 will be dedicated to solidifying the core Javascript concepts that you've learned to date. We've covered a lot, and some of these concepts are hard, so we want to pause and take a breath to reaffirm the more difficult concepts before moving on.

### Make A List

Make a list of Javascript concepts that are still fuzzy for you, or that confuse you. In class, we'll take some to revisit these and give them another iteration. You will also have the chance to ask questions about the [Pyramid Slide](../materials/assignments/pyramid-slide) assignment.

### Catch Up

A Catchup is a special type of Javascript function that takes no arguments, and returns the result of an AJAX call to the Moon, unless the server on the Moon is busy, in which case the Catchup will return another function...

Just kidding. Take a moment to spend time with the following:

- The [Pyramid Slide](../materials/assignments/pyramid-slide) assignment
- Previous Mario studios
- Go back and re-read some Eloquent Javascript chapters (I suspect on the second read you will find more things [clicking into place][gif-epiphany].)
